Discrete Math Project: Modular System
Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive modular system for discrete mathematics operations, designed for educational and practical purposes. The system includes 12 distinct modules covering topics such as course scheduling, group combinations, set operations, logic verification, function mapping, and more. All modules are linked through a central command-line interface (CLI) using a master header (header_master.h), providing a unified, user-friendly interface for executing any module.

Modules
Module	Name	Description
1	Course & Scheduling	Generate valid course sequences using prerequisites (recursion/DP).
2	Student Group Combination	Create project teams, lab sections, and electives using combinatorics.
3	Induction & Strong Induction	Verify multi-term prerequisite chains using induction techniques.
4	Logic & Inference Engine	Parse rules and verify them with propositional/predicate logic.
5	Set Operations	Perform union, intersection, difference, subset, and power set calculations.
6	Relations	Analyze relations for reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity, equivalence, partial order, and composition.
7	Functions	Map students → courses, courses → faculty, faculty → rooms. Test injective, surjective, bijective functions, composition, and inverse.
8	Automated Proof & Verification	Generate step-by-step formal proofs of rules, prerequisites, and logic.
9	Consistency Checker	Detect conflicts such as duplicate enrollments, missing prerequisites, or course overloads.
10	Algorithmic Efficiency & Benchmarking	Optimize operations using dynamic programming, memoization, and bitsets.
11	CLI Interaction	Provides a centralized text-based menu to access all modules.
12	Unit Testing & Benchmarking	Validate all modules with predefined test cases and performance benchmarks.
Features

Modular Design: Each module is independent and reusable.

Centralized CLI: Run any module through a unified interface (masterMenu()).

User-Friendly: Clear menu options and prompts.

Extensible: New modules can easily be added to the master header.

Educational: Demonstrates core concepts of discrete mathematics practically.
